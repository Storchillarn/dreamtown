# Dreamtown
This is a promotional site for my band, Dreamtown. The project is largely vanilla js in the front-end. One goal of the project was to learn more about Webpack, which is why the configuration is perhaps a bit more sophisticated than what is warranted by the application scope. 

I've integrated Google's reCaptcha, which I'm using in conjunction with a Nodemailer setup for handling form submissions.
